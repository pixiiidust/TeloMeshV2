|---------|------------------|------------------|----------------------|
| Small   | 2.1 GB           | 1.4 GB           | 240 MB               |

## WSJF Threshold Calculation Comparison

One of the key improvements in TeloMesh is the robust WSJF threshold calculation method, which properly handles zero-inflated datasets. The table below compares the original percentile-based method with the new Median + MAD approach:

| Dataset | % Non-zero Scores | Original Method (90th pctl) | New Method (Median+MAD) | % Identified as Chokepoints |
|---------|-------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------|----------------------------|
| Small   | 100%              | 0.235                      | 0.247                 | 10.2%                      |
| Medium  | 100%              | 0.242                      | 0.253                 | 11.3%                      |
| Large   | 10%               | ~0.000                     | 0.184                 | 8.4%                       |

The original method failed completely on the large dataset because the 90th percentile was 0.0 due to the high percentage of zero scores. The new method successfully identifies a reasonable threshold regardless of dataset size or zero-inflation.

## Scalability Analysis

The graph below represents how processing time scales with dataset size:

   |          /           /           /

              10K         20K        100K   Users
```

**Key Findings**:
- Processing time scales linearly with dataset size (O(n))
- Memory usage increases slightly super-linearly (O(n log n))
- The new robust WSJF threshold calculation maintains constant time complexity regardless of dataset size

## Optimizations for Large Datasets

For large datasets (100K+ users), the following optimizations are automatically applied when using the `--fast` flag:

1. **Sampling for Complex Metrics**: Uses statistical sampling for fractal dimension calculation
2. **Simplified Percolation**: Uses a faster approximation algorithm for percolation threshold
3. **Parallel Processing**: Utilizes multi-core processing for independent calculations
4. **Memory Optimization**: Uses chunked processing to reduce peak memory usage
5. **Robust Threshold Calculation**: Filters zero scores before statistical calculations

## Recommendations for Different Dataset Sizes

| Dataset Size | Recommendation |
|--------------|---------------|
| <50K users   | Standard processing with full metrics calculation |
| 50K-200K users | Use `--fast` flag for optimized processing |
| >200K users  | Consider data sampling or temporal filtering |

## Conclusion

TeloMesh now handles datasets of all sizes efficiently, with processing time scaling linearly with input size. The improved WSJF threshold calculation ensures consistent chokepoint detection regardless of zero-inflation in the dataset.

For most business applications (10K-100K users), processing completes in reasonable time (1-12 minutes) on standard hardware. For very large datasets (1M+ users), sampling or temporal filtering is recommended to maintain reasonable processing times.
