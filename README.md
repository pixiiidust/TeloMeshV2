## Overview

TeloMesh is a user-journey analysis pipeline that transforms session and event data into a directed graph of user flows. It provides:

- **Actionable decision logic** for product and UX teams to identify patterns, triage chokepoints, and prioritize improvements  
- **Efficient opportunity detection** using advanced network-analysis metrics  
- **Scalable performance** for large datasets, with tailored UX recommendations  

By turning exported session data from Mixpanel, Amplitude, or GA4 into graph-based diagnostics, TeloMesh reveals where friction clusters, why users drop off, and which fixes matter most.

### WIP Preview of Advanced Metrics dashboard (Section 4): 
Advanced Network Metrics leverages network science techniques to provide deeper structural insights into complex user flows:

* **Network Structure Metrics:** Analyze user journeys that branch and repeat at multiple scales (Fractal Dimension), hierarchical structure (Power-Law Alpha), and system stability (Percolation Threshold) with visual risk indicators

* **Decision Table & Recommendations:** Receive specific UX improvement suggestions for each page based on its structural importance and friction score, sorted by priority

* **Priority Matrix Visualization:** Plot pages by Fractal Betweenness (structural importance) vs. WSJF (user friction) to identify high-impact optimization opportunities

* **Recurring Pattern Detection:** Uncover common navigation loops and repeated sequences that may indicate users getting stuck in circular journeys

* **Network Stability Analysis:** Evaluate system resilience and identify critical pages that could disrupt the entire user experience if removed or modified

## For Product Teams

TeloMesh helps product teams by:
- Quantifying UX friction points for prioritization
- Visualizing critical user journey bottlenecks
- Identifying high-impact improvement opportunities
- Providing data-driven insights for roadmap planning
- Enabling before/after comparisons of UX changes
- Generating specific UX recommendations based on network metrics
- Optimizing performance for large datasets with fast mode

By combining exit rates with structural importance, the WSJF scoring system ensures that improvements focus on areas with the highest impact on overall user experience.

## Theory & Methodology

TeloMesh applies network science and graph theory to user experience analysis, creating a systematic approach to prioritizing UX improvements:

### Core Framework: WSJF Prioritization
**WSJF** (Weighted Shortest Job First) is an Agile prioritization method that ranks work by value-to-effort ratio, helping teams focus on high-impact, low-effort improvements. TeloMesh extends this concept to UX optimization:

### 1. Journey Mapping & Analysis
- **Graph Construction**: Convert user sessions into directed graphs where:
  - Nodes represent pages/screens
  - Edges represent user actions (events)
  - Edge weights correspond to transition frequency
  - MultiDiGraph option preserves individual transitions

- **Friction Detection**: Identify problem areas using a composite scoring system:
  - **Exit Rate**: Percentage of users abandoning at specific (page, event) pairs
  - **Betweenness Centrality**: Measures node importance in the overall flow structure
  - **WSJF Friction Score**: Calculated as `exit_rate Ã— betweenness`, highlighting high-impact friction points

### 2. Pattern Recognition & Structural Analysis
- **UX Pattern Recognition**: Identify common interaction patterns:
  - Linear bottlenecks: Sequential paths with high friction
  - Hub-and-spoke structures: Central pages with multiple connections
  - Tree hierarchies: Navigational branches with varying friction
  - Complex meshes: Interconnected page networks requiring simplification

- **Percolation Analysis**: Identify critical network components:
  - Critical junctions where small improvements yield large UX gains
  - Cascading failure patterns where multiple friction points compound
  - Fragile flows where users encounter multiple high-WSJF obstacles

### 3. Advanced Network Metrics
- **Fractal Dimension** (1.0-3.0): Measures the complexity of user navigation patterns
- **Power-law Alpha** (2.0-5.0): Quantifies degree distribution characteristics
- **Clustering Coefficient** (0.0-1.0): Measures how interconnected pages are
- **Percolation Threshold** (0.0-1.0): Identifies critical points for network collapse
- **Fractal Betweenness**: Enhanced centrality measure that considers repeating subgraph patterns
