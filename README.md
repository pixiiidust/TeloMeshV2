# TeloMesh (Early Access Prototype)

* TeloMesh is a user journey analysis pipeline that processes session and event data to build a directed graph of user flows. 
* Provides actionable decision logic for product and UX managers to identify UX patterns, triage chokepoints, and prioritize high signal metrics.
* Efficiently outputs optimization opportunities from user flow data with advanced network analysis metrics.
* Features performance optimization for large datasets and specific UX recommendations based on network characteristics.

## Why use TeloMesh? 

TeloMesh enhances existing analytics platforms such as Mixpanel / Amplitude / GA4 by turning exported session data into graph-based UX diagnosticsâ€”revealing where friction clusters, why users drop off, and which fixes matter most.

## Theory & Methodology

TeloMesh uses graph theory and network analysis to identify friction points in user journeys and prioritizes them using WSJF. 

WSJF (Weighted Shortest Job First) is a prioritization method used in Agile and Lean development (especially the Scaled Agile Framework - SAFe) that ranks work items by dividing their value by their effort, so teams tackle the highest-value, lowest-effort tasks first:

1. **Graph Construction**: User sessions are converted into directed graphs where:
   - Nodes represent pages/screens
   - Edges represent user actions (events)
   - Edge weights correspond to transition frequency
   - MultiDiGraph option preserves all individual transitions

2. **Friction Detection Algorithm**: TeloMesh identifies problem areas using a composite scoring system:
   - **Exit Rate**: Percentage of users who abandon their journey at a specific (page, event) pair
   - **Betweenness Centrality**: Measures how critical a node is to the overall flow structure
   - **WSJF Friction Score**: Calculated as `exit_rate Ã— betweenness`, prioritizing high-impact friction points

3. **Advanced Network Analysis**: TeloMesh employs sophisticated network science techniques:
   - **Fractal Dimension**: Measures the complexity of user navigation patterns (1.0-3.0)
   - **Power-law Alpha**: Quantifies the degree distribution characteristics (typically 2.0-5.0)
   - **Clustering Coefficient**: Measures how interconnected pages are (0.0-1.0)
   - **Percolation Threshold**: Identifies the critical point at which the network collapses (0.0-1.0)
   - **Fractal Betweenness**: Enhanced centrality measure that considers repeating subgraph patterns

4. **UX Pattern Recognition**: The system identifies common UI/UX patterns:
   - Linear bottlenecks: Sequential paths with high friction
   - Hub-and-spoke structures: Central pages with multiple connections
   - Tree hierarchies: Navigational branches with varying friction
   - Complex meshes: Interconnected page networks requiring simplification

5. **Percolation Analysis**: Inspired by network percolation theory, TeloMesh identifies:
   - Critical junctions where small improvements yield large UX gains
   - Cascading failure patterns where multiple friction points compound
   - Fragile flows where users encounter multiple high-WSJF obstacles

## For Product Managers

TeloMesh helps product managers by:
- Quantifying UX friction points for prioritization
- Visualizing critical user journey bottlenecks
- Identifying high-impact improvement opportunities
- Providing data-driven insights for roadmap planning
- Enabling before/after comparisons of UX changes
- Generating specific UX recommendations based on network metrics
- Optimizing performance for large datasets with fast mode

By combining exit rates with structural importance, the WSJF scoring system ensures that improvements focus on areas with the highest impact on overall user experience.

Advanced Network Metrics leverages network science techniques to provide deeper structural insights into complex user flows:

* **Network Structure Metrics:** Analyze user journeys that branch and repeat at multiple scales (Fractal Dimension), hierarchical structure (Power-Law Alpha), and system stability (Percolation Threshold) with visual risk indicators

* **Decision Table & Recommendations:** Receive specific UX improvement suggestions for each page based on its structural importance and friction score, sorted by priority

* **Priority Matrix Visualization:** Plot pages by Fractal Betweenness (structural importance) vs. WSJF (user friction) to identify high-impact optimization opportunities

* **Recurring Pattern Detection:** Uncover common navigation loops and repeated sequences that may indicate users getting stuck in circular journeys

* **Network Stability Analysis:** Evaluate system resilience and identify critical pages that could disrupt the entire user experience if removed or modified
