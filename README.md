## Theory & Methodology

TeloMesh uses graph theory and network analysis to identify friction points in user journeys and prioritizes them using WSJF. 

WSJF (Weighted Shortest Job First) is a prioritization method used in Agile and Lean development (especially the Scaled Agile Framework - SAFe) that ranks work items by dividing their value by their effort, so teams tackle the highest-value, lowest-effort tasks first:

1. **Graph Construction**: User sessions are converted into directed graphs where:
   - Nodes represent pages/screens
   - Edges represent user actions (events)
   - Edge weights correspond to transition frequency
   - MultiDiGraph option preserves all individual transitions

2. **Friction Detection Algorithm**: TeloMesh identifies problem areas using a composite scoring system:
   - **Exit Rate**: Percentage of users who abandon their journey at a specific (page, event) pair
   - **Betweenness Centrality**: Measures how critical a node is to the overall flow structure
   - **WSJF Friction Score**: Calculated as `exit_rate Ã— betweenness`, prioritizing high-impact friction points

3. **Advanced Network Analysis**: TeloMesh employs sophisticated network science techniques:
   - **Fractal Dimension**: Measures the complexity of user navigation patterns (1.0-3.0)
   - **Power-law Alpha**: Quantifies the degree distribution characteristics (typically 2.0-5.0)
   - **Clustering Coefficient**: Measures how interconnected pages are (0.0-1.0)
   - **Percolation Threshold**: Identifies the critical point at which the network collapses (0.0-1.0)
   - **Fractal Betweenness**: Enhanced centrality measure that considers repeating subgraph patterns

4. **UX Pattern Recognition**: The system identifies common UI/UX patterns:
   - Linear bottlenecks: Sequential paths with high friction
   - Hub-and-spoke structures: Central pages with multiple connections
   - Tree hierarchies: Navigational branches with varying friction
   - Complex meshes: Interconnected page networks requiring simplification

5. **Percolation Analysis**: Inspired by network percolation theory, TeloMesh identifies:
   - Critical junctions where small improvements yield large UX gains
   - Cascading failure patterns where multiple friction points compound
   - Fragile flows where users encounter multiple high-WSJF obstacles

## For Product Managers

TeloMesh helps product managers by:
- Quantifying UX friction points for prioritization
- Visualizing critical user journey bottlenecks
- Identifying high-impact improvement opportunities
- Providing data-driven insights for roadmap planning
- Enabling before/after comparisons of UX changes
- Generating specific UX recommendations based on network metrics
- Optimizing performance for large datasets with fast mode

By combining exit rates with structural importance, the WSJF scoring system ensures that improvements focus on areas with the highest impact on overall user experience.
