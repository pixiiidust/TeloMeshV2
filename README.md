# TeloMesh

TeloMesh is a user journey analysis pipeline that processes event data to build a directed graph of user flows. This tool helps product managers and UX designers identify patterns, chokepoints, and optimization opportunities in user journeys.

## Theory & Methodology

TeloMesh uses graph theory and network analysis to identify friction points in user journeys:

1. **Graph Construction**: User sessions are converted into directed graphs where:
   - Nodes represent pages/screens
   - Edges represent user actions (events)
   - Edge weights correspond to transition frequency

2. **Friction Detection Algorithm**: TeloMesh identifies problem areas using a composite scoring system:
   - **Exit Rate**: Percentage of users who abandon their journey at a specific (page, event) pair
   - **Betweenness Centrality**: Measures how critical a node is to the overall flow structure
   - **WSJF Friction Score**: Calculated as `exit_rate Ã— betweenness`, prioritizing high-impact friction points

3. **Percolation Analysis**: Inspired by network percolation theory, TeloMesh identifies:
   - Critical junctions where small improvements yield large UX gains
   - Cascading failure patterns where multiple friction points compound
   - Fragile flows where users encounter multiple high-WSJF obstacles

## Key Features

### 1. Friction Points Analysis
- Identifies and ranks individual (page, event) pairs by WSJF Friction Score
- Calculates exit probability and lost user volume
- Highlights structural weaknesses in the user journey

### 2. User Flow Heatmap
- Visual representation of user journeys with friction highlighted
- Color-coded nodes based on friction percentile (top 10%, top 20%)
- Interactive graph visualization with tooltips and event details

### 3. Fragile Flows Detection
- Identifies user paths containing multiple high-friction points
- Highlights sequences where users encounter cascading obstacles
- Prioritizes flow improvements based on cumulative friction

## For Product Managers

TeloMesh helps product managers by:
- Quantifying UX friction points for prioritization
- Visualizing critical user journey bottlenecks
- Identifying high-impact improvement opportunities
- Providing data-driven insights for roadmap planning
- Enabling before/after comparisons of UX changes

By combining exit rates with structural importance, the WSJF scoring system ensures that improvements focus on areas with the highest impact on overall user experience.

## New in Version 2
- Enhanced dashboard with export features
- Friction Intelligence visualization
- Dark theme with improved UX

### Key Files

- `main.py` - Entry point for the pipeline with command-line arguments
- `requirements.txt` - Package dependencies for easy installation
- `directory_structure.lua` - Canonical definition of project structure
- `README.md` - Project documentation (this file)

## Usage

### Running the Full Pipeline

```bash
python main.py --users 100 --events 50
```

This will:
1. Generate synthetic events
2. Parse events into sessions
3. Build a user journey graph
4. Validate flow metrics
5. Analyze friction points
6. Prepare data for dashboard

### Running the Dashboard

```bash
streamlit run ui/dashboard.py
```

This will launch the TeloMesh Friction Intelligence Dashboard with the following features:
- Friction Points table with export to CSV
- User Flow Heatmap with export to HTML
- Fragile Flows visualization with export to CSV
