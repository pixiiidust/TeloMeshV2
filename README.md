# TeloMesh

TeloMesh is a user journey analysis pipeline that processes session and event data to build a directed graph of user flows. 
This tool provides an actionable overview that helps product managers and UX designers identify patterns, triage chokepoints, and prioritize optimization opportunities in user journeys.

## Key Features

### 1. Friction Points Analysis
- Identifies and ranks individual (page, event) pairs by WSJF Friction Score
- Calculates exit probability and lost user volume
- Highlights structural weaknesses in the user journey

### 2. User Journey Graph
- Visual representation of user journeys with friction highlighted
- Color-coded nodes based on friction percentile (top 10%, top 20%)
- Interactive graph visualization with tooltips and event details

### 3. User Flow Analysis
- Identifies user paths containing multiple high-friction points
- Highlights sequences where users encounter cascading obstacles
- Prioritizes flow improvements based on cumulative friction

### 4. Dataset Organization

## Theory & Methodology

TeloMesh uses graph theory and network analysis to identify friction points in user journeys and prioritizes them using WSJF. WSJF (Weighted Shortest Job First) is a prioritization method used in Agile and Lean development (especially the Scaled Agile Framework - SAFe) that ranks work items by dividing their value by their effort, so teams tackle the highest-value, lowest-effort tasks first:

1. **Graph Construction**: User sessions are converted into directed graphs where:
   - Nodes represent pages/screens
   - Edges represent user actions (events)
   - Edge weights correspond to transition frequency

2. **Friction Detection Algorithm**: TeloMesh identifies problem areas using a composite scoring system:
   - **Exit Rate**: Percentage of users who abandon their journey at a specific (page, event) pair
   - **Betweenness Centrality**: Measures how critical a node is to the overall flow structure
   - **WSJF Friction Score**: Calculated as `exit_rate Ã— betweenness`, prioritizing high-impact friction points

3. **Percolation Analysis**: Inspired by network percolation theory, TeloMesh identifies:
   - Critical junctions where small improvements yield large UX gains
   - Cascading failure patterns where multiple friction points compound
   - Fragile flows where users encounter multiple high-WSJF obstacles

## For Product Managers

TeloMesh helps product managers by:
- Quantifying UX friction points for prioritization
- Visualizing critical user journey bottlenecks
- Identifying high-impact improvement opportunities
- Providing data-driven insights for roadmap planning
- Enabling before/after comparisons of UX changes

By combining exit rates with structural importance, the WSJF scoring system ensures that improvements focus on areas with the highest impact on overall user experience.

## New in Version 2.1

- **Distributed Processing**: Support for processing large datasets across multiple nodes
- **Performance Benchmarks**: Standard tests to evaluate processing time across different dataset sizes

### Enhanced User Interface
- **Web-Based Upload Interface**: A frontend interface allowing users to directly upload analytics files
- **Drag-and-Drop Data Import**: Intuitive interface for importing and mapping data
- **Visualization Exports**: Additional export formats for reports and presentations

### Advanced Analytics
