# Analysis Outputs

This folder contains the generated data files that serve as inputs to the TeloMesh dashboard visualization. All outputs are now organized by dataset in dedicated subdirectories.

## Key Output Files
- `session_flows.csv`: Structured user session paths with event sequences
- `user_graph.gpickle`: NetworkX graph representation of user journeys
- `user_graph_multi.gpickle`: Multi-edge graph preserving all individual transitions
- `event_chokepoints.csv`: Ranked friction points with WSJF scores
- `high_friction_flows.csv`: User flows containing multiple high-friction points
- `friction_node_map.json`: Node scoring data for visualization heat mapping
- `decision_table.csv`: UX recommendations based on network analysis
- `final_report.json`: Summary of key network metrics and insights
- `final_report.csv`: Tabular format of network metrics for easy import
- `dataset_info.json`: Metadata about the dataset generation parameters

```

## Advanced Metrics
The new output files include detailed network analytics:
- **Fractal Dimension**: Complexity measure of the user journey structure
- **Power-law Alpha**: Characterization of the degree distribution
- **Clustering Coefficient**: Measure of interconnectedness between pages
- **Percolation Threshold**: Critical point for network robustness
- **Fractal Betweenness**: Centrality measures considering subgraph patterns
- **UX Recommendations**: Actionable insights based on network properties

## Usage
To generate all outputs for a specific dataset:
```bash
python main.py --dataset myproject
```

For large datasets, use the fast processing mode:
```bash
python main.py --dataset large_project --fast
```

These output files are generated by the analysis pipeline and consumed by the dashboard UI components.
