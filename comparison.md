Most **regular product teams triage user flows** using **event-based analytics**, **heuristics**, and **team intuition**, rather than structural or systems, graph-based reasoning. 

This works *well enough* for straightforward products — but it breaks down in complex, multi-step environments. Here's how the typical triage flow works:

## 🧪 The Conventional Product UX Flow Triage Process

### 1. **Start with Funnels and Drop-offs**

* Use Mixpanel, Amplitude, GA4, or Heap to build a funnel:

  ```
  Signup → Onboarding Step 1 → Onboarding Step 2 → Plan Selection → Payment
  ```
* Look for:

  * **Biggest dropoffs**
  * **Sudden dips in conversion**
* Focus tends to be on top-of-funnel and monetization exits.

---

### 2. **Segment the Funnel**

* Apply filters to see if certain segments behave differently:

  * Device type (mobile vs desktop)
  * Acquisition source (organic vs paid)
  * Geo or language
  * New vs returning
* Goal: Identify "problem segments" causing friction.

---

### 3. **Use Session Replays or Heatmaps**

* Tools: FullStory, Hotjar, LogRocket
* Watch user sessions to understand behavior around the friction points.
* Look for:

  * Rage clicks
  * Long hesitations
  * UI confusion

---

### 4. **Check Supporting Metrics**

* Load times (PageSpeed, Sentry)
* Form errors or failed API calls
* CS tickets or user feedback linked to flow steps

---

### 5. **Speculative Prioritization**

* Based on volume (e.g. "affects 28% of users")
* Based on emotion (e.g. "we *hate* this screen too")
* Based on cost (e.g. "this is a paid step — it's leaking revenue")

---

### 6. **Run Experiments or Redesign**

* A/B test a new version of the screen
* Add nudges or inline help
* Simplify steps or auto-fill data

## ⚠️ Gaps in This Approach

| Gap                                                       | Result                                                      |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Focuses on **where** users drop, not **why** structurally | Misses latent friction spread across nodes                  |
| Treats steps as **linear**, not as a **graph**            | Ignores loops, hub nodes, or multi-path flows               |
| Can't detect **cascading friction**                       | Fixes isolated issues, not systemic fragility               |
| Prioritization is often **volume-based only**             | Overlooks low-traffic but critical nodes (high betweenness) |
| Session replays are **manual & low-scale**                | Hard to triage thousands of flows intelligently             |

---

## 🧠 TeloMesh: The Upgrade

What TeloMesh does is:

* Replace **linear funnels** with **directed graphs**
* Swap **"top drop-off" thinking** with **"network fracture" thinking**
* Use **WSJF × structure** to surface **non-obvious leverage points**
* Enable **flow-level triage**, not just page-level metrics

| Funnel analysis     | Linear step-by-step | Full journey graph                  |

## Future Gains with GNN-based Machine Learning:

* Potential for GNN-Based UX Journey Optimization: From Raw Session Data to Actionable UX Insights
* Leverage GNN-based learning to optimize user journeys using real session exports.
* Go from raw logs → graph construction → GNN training → ranked UX fixes — using open-source tools like PyTorch Geometric or DGL.

### 🧪 Practical Example Pipeline

#### 1. 🧾 Data Prep: From Session Logs to Graphs

**Input**: Exported logs from Mixpanel / Amplitude / GA4  
**Required fields**:
- `user_id`, `session_id`, `event_name`, `timestamp`, `screen_name`, `converted` (or similar)

**Steps**:
- Group by `session_id` to form ordered event paths
- Construct a directed graph for each session:
  - **Nodes**: `screen_name` or `event_name`
  - **Edges**: transitions (ordered by timestamp)
  - **Node/Edge features**: time spent, delays, rage-clicks, device type, etc.
- Label each graph:
  - `1` = converted
  - `0` = dropped
  - *(optional)* Friction score for regression

**📦 Tooling**: `pandas`, `networkx`, `PyG` (PyTorch Geometric) or `DGL`

---

#### 2. 🧱 Build the GNN Dataset

Each sample = 1 session graph.

| Component       | Example                                 |
|----------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Graph**       | `G = (V, E)` user journey graph          |
| **Node features** | One-hot encoded page, time on page, mobile/desktop |
| **Edge features** | Transition delay, number of retries     |
| **Label**       | `y = 1` if converted, else `0`           |

*Optional: augment dataset with synthetic flows or weak friction labels.*

---

#### 3. 🧠 Choose Your GNN Architecture

| Task Type               | Recommended Model            |
|-------------------------|------------------------------|
| **Classification**      | `GCN` or `GAT`               |
| **Friction Prediction** | `GraphSAGE` (scalable)       |
| **Flow Embedding**      | Triplet GNN / InfoNCE        |
| **Node Risk Scoring**   | Node-wise `GCN`              |

📦 Use [PyTorch Geometric](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/) or [DGL](https://www.dgl.ai/) to implement the models.

---

#### 4. 🎯 Train the Model

- Use `DataLoader` for batched session graphs
- Choose a loss function:
  - `BCE` for classification (converted vs dropped)
  - `MSE` for friction regression
  - `TripletLoss` for contrastive session embedding
- Train over `20–50 epochs`
- Evaluate using:
  - Accuracy (classification)
  - RMSE (regression)
  - TSNE / PCA (embedding space separation)

---

#### 5. 📈 Generate UX Optimization Insights

| Task                    | Output Example                               |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Predict success         | Score sessions for likelihood of conversion  |
| Rank pain points        | Identify nodes with high dropout influence   |
| Cluster flows           | Group similar journeys by behavior           |
| Surface risky patterns  | Detect loops, retries, dead-ends             |
| Simulate improvements   | Remove/adjust node → re-score impact         |

**Deliverables**: Ranked UX fix list, flow similarity maps, predictive diagnostics.

#### 6. 🛠️ Plug Into Product Workflow

| Integration Point       | Method                                     |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Analytics Dashboards**| Match node names to highlight in Mixpanel/Amplitude |
| **PM Tools (e.g. JIRA)**| Export friction hotspots as fix tickets    |
| **UX Research**         | Share before/after flow graphs             |
| **Experiment Planning** | Use predictions to scope A/B variants      |

---

#### 🧠 Realistic Pilot Stack

| Layer               | Tools                            |
|---------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Data ingestion**  | `pandas`, `networkx`             |
| **Graph modeling**  | `PyG`, `DGL`                     |
| **Training & Loss** | `BCE`, `MSE`, `TripletLoss`      |
| **Embeddings Viz**  | `TSNE`, `UMAP`, `matplotlib`     |
| **Dashboards (opt)**| `Streamlit`, `Plotly`, CSV export|

---

#### 💡 Example Insight

> *"Across 100,000 sessions, the model learned that entering the ‘Plans’ page from ‘Home’ after a loop through ‘Help’ predicts a 61% dropoff rate. Removing that loop increases simulated conversion probability by 19%."*

That’s **quantitative UX diagnosis** — beyond what funnels or heatmaps can show.
