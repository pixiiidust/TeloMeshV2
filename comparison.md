Most **regular product teams triage user flows** using **event-based analytics**, **heuristics**, and **team intuition**, rather than structural or systems, graph-based reasoning. 

This works *well enough* for straightforward products ‚Äî but it breaks down in complex, multi-step environments. Here‚Äôs how the typical triage flow works:

---

## üß™ The Conventional Product UX Flow Triage Process

### 1. **Start with Funnels and Drop-offs**

* Use Mixpanel, Amplitude, GA4, or Heap to build a funnel:

  ```
  Signup ‚Üí Onboarding Step 1 ‚Üí Onboarding Step 2 ‚Üí Plan Selection ‚Üí Payment
  ```
* Look for:

  * **Biggest dropoffs**
  * **Sudden dips in conversion**
* Focus tends to be on top-of-funnel and monetization exits.

---

### 2. **Segment the Funnel**

* Apply filters to see if certain segments behave differently:

  * Device type (mobile vs desktop)
  * Acquisition source (organic vs paid)
  * Geo or language
  * New vs returning
* Goal: Identify ‚Äúproblem segments‚Äù causing friction.

---

### 3. **Use Session Replays or Heatmaps**

* Tools: FullStory, Hotjar, LogRocket
* Watch user sessions to understand behavior around the friction points.
* Look for:

  * Rage clicks
  * Long hesitations
  * UI confusion

---

### 4. **Check Supporting Metrics**

* Load times (PageSpeed, Sentry)
* Form errors or failed API calls
* CS tickets or user feedback linked to flow steps

---

### 5. **Speculative Prioritization**

* Based on volume (e.g. ‚Äúaffects 28% of users‚Äù)
* Based on emotion (e.g. ‚Äúwe *hate* this screen too‚Äù)
* Based on cost (e.g. ‚Äúthis is a paid step ‚Äî it‚Äôs leaking revenue‚Äù)

---

### 6. **Run Experiments or Redesign**

* A/B test a new version of the screen
* Add nudges or inline help
* Simplify steps or auto-fill data

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Gaps in This Approach

| Gap                                                       | Result                                                      |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Focuses on **where** users drop, not **why** structurally | Misses latent friction spread across nodes                  |
| Treats steps as **linear**, not as a **graph**            | Ignores loops, hub nodes, or multi-path flows               |
| Can‚Äôt detect **cascading friction**                       | Fixes isolated issues, not systemic fragility               |
| Prioritization is often **volume-based only**             | Overlooks low-traffic but critical nodes (high betweenness) |
| Session replays are **manual & low-scale**                | Hard to triage thousands of flows intelligently             |

## üß† TeloMesh: The Upgrade

What TeloMesh does is:

* Replace **linear funnels** with **directed graphs**
* Swap **"top drop-off" thinking** with **"network fracture" thinking**
* Use **WSJF √ó structure** to surface **non-obvious leverage points**
* Enable **flow-level triage**, not just page-level metrics

## üîÑ TL;DR Comparison

| Step                | Regular PM          | With TeloMesh                       |
| ------------------- | ------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Funnel analysis     | Linear step-by-step | Full journey graph                  |
| Prioritization      | Exit volume         | Exit √ó importance (centrality)      |
| Session analysis    | Manual video review | Structural diagnostics with metrics |
| Insight granularity | Page-level          | Flow + node + path + pattern-level  |
| Output              | Speculative roadmap | Ranked fix list w/ impact zones     |
