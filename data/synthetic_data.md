# Data Generation

This folder contains tools for generating synthetic user journey data for testing and demonstration purposes.

## Components
- Synthetic event generator for creating realistic user paths
- Session simulators with configurable friction points
- Parameter controls for adjusting user volumes and event frequencies
- Configurable abandonment patterns to test detection algorithms

The main file `synthetic_event_generator.py` creates test datasets that mimic real-world user behavior patterns with predefined friction points.
