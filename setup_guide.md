## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following components:

### Core Directories

#### `/data`
Contains input data and data generation tools:
- `events.csv` - Raw event log containing user interactions (synthetic or imported)
- `synthetic_event_generator.py` - Python script that generates realistic test data with configurable parameters

#### `/ingest`
Pipeline components for transforming raw events into structured session data:
- `parse_sessions.py` - Converts raw CSV events into structured user sessions
- `build_graph.py` - Creates a directed graph representation of user journeys
- `flow_metrics.py` - Validates sessions and graph quality metrics

#### `/analysis`
Advanced analysis components for discovering insights:
- `event_chokepoints.py` - Identifies friction points by computing exit rates and betweenness centrality

#### `/ui`
User interface components:
- `dashboard.py` - Streamlit dashboard with interactive visualizations, filtering, and data export capabilities

#### `/utils`
Utility scripts and tools:
- `analytics_converter.py` - Tool for converting data from Mixpanel, Amplitude, and GA4 to TeloMesh format

#### `/outputs`
Generated data files:
- `session_flows.csv` - Processed session data in tabular format
- `user_graph.gpickle` - Serialized NetworkX graph with user journey information
- `event_chokepoints.csv` - Identified friction points with WSJF scores
- `high_friction_flows.csv` - User journeys that contain multiple high-friction points
- `friction_node_map.json` - Mapping of pages to WSJF scores for visualization

#### `/logs`
Logging and monitoring data:
- `session_stats.log` - Log file with session validation details
- `metrics.json` - Summary metrics for quality assessment

#### `/tests`
Test suites for each component:
- `test_synthetic_events.py` - Tests for data generation
- `test_parse_sessions.py` - Tests for session parsing
- `test_build_graph.py` - Tests for graph construction
- `test_flow_metrics.py` - Tests for metrics calculation
- `test_event_chokepoints.py` - Tests for friction point identification
- `test_dashboard_ui.py` - Tests for UI components

#### `/logos`
Brand assets and visual elements:
- `Telomesh logo.png` - Primary logo for application header
- `telomesh logo white.png` - White version of logo for dark backgrounds

### Key Files

- `main.py` - Entry point for the pipeline with command-line arguments
- `requirements.txt` - Package dependencies for easy installation
- `directory_structure.lua` - Canonical definition of project structure
- `README.md` - Project documentation
- `.streamlit/config.toml` - Streamlit configuration for dark theme and UI settings
- `.gitignore` - Configuration for Git to exclude temporary files

## Usage

### Running the Full Pipeline

```bash
python main.py --users 100 --events 50
```

This will:
1. Generate synthetic events
2. Parse events into sessions
3. Build a user journey graph
4. Validate flow metrics
5. Analyze friction points
6. Prepare data for dashboard

### Running the Dashboard

```bash
streamlit run ui/dashboard.py
```

This will launch the TeloMesh User Flow Intelligence Dashboard with the following features:
- Friction Points table with export to CSV
- User Flow Heatmap with export to HTML
- Fragile Flows visualization with export to CSV

### Running Individual Stages

You can run individual stages of the pipeline:

```bash
# Generate synthetic events
python main.py --stage synthetic --users 100 --events 50

# Parse events into sessions
python main.py --stage parse

# Build user journey graph
python main.py --stage graph

# Validate flow metrics
python main.py --stage metrics

# Analyze friction points
python main.py --stage analysis
```

### Using the Analytics Converter

TeloMesh includes a powerful utility to convert data from popular analytics platforms:

```bash
# Convert data and make it ready for TeloMesh in one step
python utils/analytics_converter.py --input your_analytics_export.csv --output data/events.csv --format [platform] --telomesh-format

# Where [platform] is one of: mixpanel, amplitude, ga4
```

#### Supported Platforms:

- **Mixpanel**: Convert event exports with user, timestamp, and page information
- **Amplitude**: Convert Amplitude CSV exports with event data
- **Google Analytics 4**: Convert GA4 event exports with page and user data

#### Generate Sample Data:

If you don't have real analytics data, you can generate realistic sample data:

```bash
# Generate sample data ready for TeloMesh
python utils/analytics_converter.py --generate-sample --format amplitude --output data/events.csv --telomesh-format
```

For detailed documentation on analytics conversion, see the [Analytics Converter Guide](utils/GUIDE.md).

## WSJF Friction Scoring

TeloMesh uses a Weighted Shortest Job First (WSJF) approach to prioritize friction points:

`WSJF_Friction_Score = exit_rate Ã— betweenness`

Where:
- `exit_rate`: Probability of session ending after the event
- `betweenness`: Page's structural importance in user flows

## Troubleshooting

- **Missing dependencies**: Ensure all packages in `requirements.txt` are installed
- **File not found errors**: Check that all input files exist in the specified paths
- **Graph visualization issues**: Try adjusting node count filters in the dashboard
- **Streamlit theme errors**: If you encounter theme-related errors, make sure your Streamlit version is compatible with the theme options used or update `.streamlit/config.toml`

## Next Steps

After identifying friction points, consider:
1. Prioritizing improvements based on WSJF scores
2. Running A/B tests on identified problematic flows
3. Monitoring metrics over time to track progress
